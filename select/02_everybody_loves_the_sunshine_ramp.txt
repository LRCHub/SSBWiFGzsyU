Sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Folks get down in the sunshine, sunshine
Folks get brown in the sunshine

Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers

My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine

Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Folks get down in the sunshine, sunshine
