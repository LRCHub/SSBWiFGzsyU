Love on the playa
Drinking cerveza
Every cam to Ibiza
Walking with your boyfriend every night

Everybody loves the sunshine, happy people - oeo
Everybody is on vacation
Playing on the beach and having fun

While your holiday is there
Oh, there's dancing in the air
Very soon you'll fly away, oho
To the Méditerranée

Love on the playa
Drinking cerveza
Every cam to Ibiza
Walking with your boyfriend every night

Everybody loves the sunshine, happy people - oeo
Everybody is on vacation
Playing on the beach and having fun
